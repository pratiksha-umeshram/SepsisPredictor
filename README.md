# SepsisPredictor
"An open-source project focused on using machine learning techniques to predict and analyze sepsis disease patterns. The goal is to develop predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention."
The "Septic Detection Project" is a data-driven initiative aimed at developing an efficient and 
accurate system for early detection and prediction of septic shock in patients. Septic shock is a life-threatening 
medical condition caused by severe infection, leading to a dangerous drop in blood pressure and organ 
dysfunction. Timely identification of sepsis is crucial for effective medical intervention and improved patient 
outcomes.

Objectives: The primary objective of the septic detection project is to create a robust and reliable machine 
learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of septic shock in patients based on relevant clinical 
data. By achieving this goal, the project aims to:
• Improve early diagnosis and intervention for patients at risk of sepsis
• Reduce sepsis-related mortality rates and improve patient survival rates
• Enhance the overall quality of healthcare services provided to patients
